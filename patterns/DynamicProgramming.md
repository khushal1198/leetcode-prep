## linear_dp

**What it is** — Linear DP solves problems where the optimal answer at position `i` depends only on a fixed number of previous positions (e.g., `dp[i-1]`, `dp[i-2]`, or a range). Recognize this pattern when you can scan an array or sequence left-to-right and each state's answer is built from a small window of prior states. Classic signals are "maximum subarray," "minimum cost to reach here," or recurrences like Fibonacci-style counting.

**Common steps**
1. Define `dp[i]` clearly — what does it represent at index `i`? (e.g., max sum ending at `i`, min cost to reach `i`)
2. Identify the recurrence: which prior states does `dp[i]` depend on? Write the formula explicitly.
3. Handle base cases: set `dp[0]` (and `dp[1]` if needed) before the main loop.
4. Iterate left-to-right, computing `dp[i]` from the recurrence.
5. Extract the answer — it may be `dp[n-1]`, `max(dp)`, or a running aggregation.
6. Optimize space if the recurrence only looks back a fixed number of steps (use rolling variables instead of an array).

**Key variations**
- Single-value recurrence (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs): `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`
- Subarray problems (Kadane's): track "best ending here" vs "best seen so far"
- Skip/take decisions (House Robber): `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + val[i])`
- Cost-based traversal (Min Cost Climbing Stairs, Minimum Cost for Tickets): pick among a few jump sizes
- Circular array variants (House Robber II): run linear DP twice on two overlapping subarrays
- Multi-state linear DP (Max Product Subarray): maintain multiple parallel dp arrays (e.g., max and min ending here)

## probability_dp

**What it is** — Probability DP computes the likelihood of an outcome after a sequence of random events, where each step's probability depends on a previous state. Recognize it when the problem asks "what is the probability that..." after some number of moves or trials, and the transitions are well-defined (dice rolls, random walks, card draws). The state typically encodes how much of some resource remains and the probability of being in that configuration.

**Common steps**
1. Define `dp[state]` as the probability of being in that state (e.g., `dp[i][j]` = probability of being at cell `(i,j)` after `k` steps).
2. Initialize: set `dp[start_state] = 1.0`, all others to `0.0`.
3. For each step/trial, propagate probabilities: for each current state, distribute its probability mass to reachable next states weighted by transition probability.
4. After all steps, sum `dp` over the desired outcome states.
5. Watch for precision: use floating point carefully, or check if the problem allows integer counting with modular arithmetic.

**Key variations**
- Fixed number of steps with position tracking (Knight Probability): iterate step-by-step over a grid
- Sliding window / threshold stopping (New 21 Game): accumulate probabilities up to a boundary using a running window sum
- Soup servings with early stopping: recognize when probability converges and short-circuit for large inputs
- Problems that look like probability but reduce to combinatorics: verify if exact counting is possible

## grid_dp

**What it is** — Grid DP solves problems on a 2D matrix where you move between cells (typically top-to-bottom or in all directions) and the value of a cell depends on adjacent cells already computed. Recognize it when the problem involves paths, counts, or properties in a grid and movement is constrained (e.g., only right/down, or only to increasing neighbors). The state is the cell coordinates, often augmented with extra dimensions.

**Common steps**
1. Define `dp[r][c]` as the answer for the subproblem ending at cell `(r, c)` (e.g., min path cost, number of paths, max cherries).
2. Identify which prior cells feed into `dp[r][c]` based on movement rules (e.g., from `dp[r-1][c]` and `dp[r][c-1]` for top-down-only movement).
3. Initialize the boundary: fill the first row and first column (or use sentinel values) as base cases.
4. Fill the grid in topological order (row-by-row for DAG movement, or use memoized DFS for general directed graphs).
5. Handle obstacles or constraints by skipping invalid cells (set to infinity or -1).
6. Read the answer from `dp[m-1][n-1]` or aggregate across a row/column as needed.

**Key variations**
- Counting paths (Unique Paths, Out of Boundary Paths): accumulate sums, watch for modulo
- Optimization paths (Minimum Path Sum, Dungeon Game): min/max over predecessors; Dungeon Game requires reverse traversal
- Square/rectangle substructure (Maximal Square, Count Square Submatrices): `dp[r][c] = min(dp[r-1][c], dp[r][c-1], dp[r-1][c-1]) + 1`
- Longest increasing path: requires memoized DFS since movement is not strictly left-to-right
- Multi-agent simultaneous traversal (Cherry Pickup II): add a third dimension for the second agent's column
- Reverse DP (Dungeon Game): when you need to satisfy a future constraint, fill the grid from bottom-right to top-left

## subsequence_dp

**What it is** — Subsequence DP finds optimal or countable subsequences (not necessarily contiguous) within one or two sequences, where the value at index `i` depends on all prior choices. Recognize it when the problem asks for the longest, shortest, or number-of ways to select elements in order from an array or string, without requiring contiguity. The canonical examples are LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence) and LCS (Longest Common Subsequence).

**Common steps**
1. For single-sequence problems: define `dp[i]` as the answer for subsequences ending at index `i`. For two-sequence problems: define `dp[i][j]` as the answer considering the first `i` elements of sequence A and first `j` of sequence B.
2. Write the recurrence by deciding whether to include element `i` (and `j`) in the subsequence.
3. For LIS-style: `dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1)` for all `j < i` where `arr[j] < arr[i]`.
4. For LCS-style: if elements match, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`; otherwise `max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
5. Initialize to base cases (empty subsequences = 0 or 1 depending on definition).
6. For LIS, optimize from O(n^2) to O(n log n) using binary search with a patience-sorting array when only the length (not reconstruction) is needed.

**Key variations**
- LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence): classic O(n^2) or O(n log n) with binary search
- LCS (Longest Common Subsequence): 2D DP on two strings/arrays
- Counting subsequences (Distinct Subsequences, Number of LIS): track count alongside length
- Constrained subsequences (Longest Arithmetic Subsequence): use a hashmap for `dp[i][diff]`
- Reconstruction: backtrack through the dp table or store parent pointers
- Subsequence with custom ordering (Largest Divisible Subset, Best Team): sort first, then apply LIS-style DP

## knapsack

**What it is** — Knapsack DP selects items from a set subject to a capacity constraint to optimize (maximize value or count ways to hit a target). Recognize it when you have a collection of items with weights/costs and the problem asks for the best selection under a budget, or the number of ways to reach a target sum. The key insight is that each item can be used once (0/1 knapsack) or unlimited times (unbounded knapsack).

**Common steps**
1. Define `dp[w]` as the best value (or number of ways) achievable with exactly (or at most) capacity `w`.
2. Initialize: `dp[0] = 0` (or 1 for counting), `dp[w] = infinity` (or 0) for `w > 0`.
3. For 0/1 knapsack, iterate items in the outer loop and capacities in the **inner loop going backwards** (to prevent reuse of the same item).
4. For unbounded knapsack (Coin Change), iterate capacities in the **inner loop going forwards** (allowing reuse).
5. For each item with weight `w` and value `v`: `dp[cap] = min/max(dp[cap], dp[cap - w] + v)` or `dp[cap] += dp[cap - w]` for counting.
6. Read the answer from `dp[target]` or `dp[capacity]`.

**Key variations**
- 0/1 knapsack (Partition Equal Subset Sum, Target Sum): each item used at most once; iterate capacity backwards
- Unbounded knapsack (Coin Change, Coin Change II): items reusable; iterate capacity forwards
- Exact target vs. at-most: adjust initialization (`dp[0]=1` for counting ways to reach exactly target)
- 2D knapsack (Ones and Zeroes): two capacity dimensions; iterate both backwards
- Bounded knapsack: each item has a limited count; use binary grouping or sliding window optimization

## counting_dp

**What it is** — Counting DP counts the number of distinct ways to construct something (arrangements, sequences, structures) satisfying given constraints, modulo a prime. Recognize it when the problem asks "in how many ways..." and the answer grows exponentially without DP. The state captures how much of the structure has been built and what constraints remain active.

**Common steps**
1. Define `dp[state]` as the number of valid configurations for that state (e.g., `dp[i]` = ways to build a string of length `i`, `dp[i][j]` = ways using `i` elements with property `j`).
2. Write the recurrence by summing over all valid transitions into the current state.
3. Initialize the empty/base configuration to 1 (one way to do nothing).
4. Iterate in order of increasing state, summing contributions.
5. Apply modulo at every addition step to prevent overflow: `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
6. Read `dp[target_state]` as the answer.

**Key variations**
- Sequence counting (Count Vowels Permutation, Dice Roll Simulation): each position depends on a few prior states
- Combinatorial structure (Unique BSTs, Pascal's Triangle): Catalan-number style recurrences
- Counting with forbidden patterns: subtract invalid states or track the "bad" suffix explicitly
- Counting over a grid/path (Number of Increasing Paths): memoized DFS where each state = number of paths through that cell
- Counting partitions and distributions (K Inverse Pairs, Music Playlists): 2D DP where one dimension is the count constraint

## state_machine_dp

**What it is** — State machine DP models systems that move between a small, fixed set of explicit states (e.g., holding/not holding a stock, cooldown period, color choice), where the best outcome at step `i` depends on which state you were in at step `i-1`. Recognize it when the problem has mode-switching decisions — you can only do action B after doing action A, or being in state X prevents certain transitions. The dp table has one axis for position and one for state.

**Common steps**
1. Enumerate all meaningful states (e.g., for stocks: `held`, `not_held`, `cooldown`).
2. Define `dp[i][state]` as the best value after processing element `i` while in `state`.
3. Write transitions: for each state at step `i`, determine which states at step `i-1` can lead to it and at what cost.
4. Initialize step 0 for each state (often `dp[0][held] = -prices[0]`, `dp[0][not_held] = 0`).
5. Iterate forward, applying all transitions at each step.
6. Return the maximum over all "terminal" states at the last step (typically any non-held state).

**Key variations**
- Stock problems (Buy/Sell with cooldown, fee, k transactions): the core template; number of states grows with constraints
- Color/label assignment (Paint House, Paint Fence): states are the color choices; transitions forbid adjacent same colors
- Bounded transactions (Best Time IV): add a third dimension for number of transactions used
- Sequential movement with lanes (Minimum Sideway Jumps): state is the current lane
- Sequence generation with forbidden patterns (Student Attendance, Dice Roll Simulation): state encodes the recent history of choices

## string_dp

**What it is** — String DP solves problems involving one or two strings where the answer depends on relationships between substrings or characters at specific positions. Recognize it when the problem asks to transform, match, segment, or compare strings with edit operations, wildcards, or dictionary lookups. The state typically encodes how far along each string you've processed.

**Common steps**
1. For two-string problems: create a 2D table `dp[i][j]` representing the answer for `s1[:i]` and `s2[:j]`.
2. For single-string segmentation (Word Break, Decode Ways): use 1D `dp[i]` = answer for the prefix of length `i`.
3. Write the recurrence based on whether the current characters match (or what edit operation to apply).
4. For Edit Distance: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` if chars match; else `1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])`.
5. Initialize: empty string bases (`dp[0][j]`, `dp[i][0]`).
6. For segmentation, iterate over all valid splits at each position and check dictionary/pattern membership.

**Key variations**
- Edit distance family (Edit Distance, Delete Operations, Min ASCII Delete Sum): vary cost function and what operations are allowed
- Pattern matching with wildcards (Wildcard Matching, Regular Expression): handle `*` specially — it can match zero or more characters
- String segmentation (Word Break, Decode Ways): `dp[i] = OR over all j where s[j:i] is valid word`
- Interleaving / merging strings (Interleaving String): `dp[i][j]` = can we form `s3[:i+j]` from `s1[:i]` and `s2[:j]`
- Palindrome-based (Palindrome Partitioning II, Valid Palindrome III): precompute palindrome table, then apply 1D DP for cuts
- Counting string constructions (Distinct Subsequences, Decode Ways II): sum valid transitions instead of taking min/max

## partition_dp

**What it is** — Partition DP splits an array or string into contiguous segments and optimizes a cost or count over all valid splits. Recognize it when the problem asks to divide a sequence into `k` parts, minimize/maximize some aggregate property of the parts, or count valid segmentations. The key transition tries all possible last-segment endpoints, making it O(n^2) or O(n^2 * k).

**Common steps**
1. Define `dp[i]` (or `dp[i][k]` with segment count) as the optimal value for the prefix ending at index `i` using at most/exactly `k` parts.
2. For each position `i`, try all previous split points `j < i`: `dp[i] = min/max over j of (dp[j] + cost(j+1, i))`.
3. Precompute any range costs (sums, max values, frequency counts) that appear inside the transition.
4. Initialize `dp[0] = 0` (cost of an empty prefix) and fill left to right.
5. For problems with a fixed number of cuts (k segments), add a second loop over `k` and fill the table row by row.
6. Optimize with the divide-and-conquer optimization or monotone queue when the cost function is concave/convex and the optimal split point is monotone.

**Key variations**
- Fixed number of partitions (Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule, Largest Sum of Averages): 2D DP with dimension for partition count
- Unconstrained segmentation (Word Break, Partition Array for Max Sum): try all split points with no limit on segment count
- Constrained segment properties (Palindrome Partitioning II, Minimum Substring Partition): precompute validity of each segment
- Counting valid partitions (Number of Beautiful Partitions): sum transitions instead of optimizing
- Quadrangle / divide-and-conquer optimization: applies when `cost(a,c) + cost(b,d) <= cost(a,d) + cost(b,c)` (intervals are concave)

## game_theory_dp

**What it is** — Game theory DP solves two-player zero-sum games where both players play optimally, and you need to determine the winner or the optimal score. Recognize it when two players alternate turns, each maximizing their own outcome, and the problem asks whether the first player wins or what the best achievable score is. The state encodes the current game configuration, and the value alternates between "maximize" and "minimize" perspectives.

**Common steps**
1. Define `dp[state]` as the best outcome the **current player** can achieve from that state (score difference, win/lose, etc.).
2. For each state, enumerate all valid moves the current player can make.
3. The current player picks the move that maximizes their result; the opponent will do the same on their turn, so: `dp[state] = max over moves of (value_of_move - dp[next_state])`.
4. Base cases: terminal states with no moves available (current player loses or score is 0).
5. Use memoization (top-down) or fill the table in reverse game-tree order (bottom-up).
6. The first player wins if `dp[initial_state] >= 0` (or > 0 for strict win).

**Key variations**
- Interval-based stone games (Stone Game I-VIII, Burst Balloons): state is a subarray `[l, r]`; current player takes from ends or a position within
- Minimax with boolean win/lose (Predict the Winner, Cat and Mouse): return true/false; current player wins if any move leads to opponent losing
- Nim-like take-away games (Stone Game IV): `dp[n]` = can current player win with `n` stones
- Graph-based games (Cat and Mouse): state includes both players' positions; requires careful cycle detection
- Games with variable move sets: enumerate all valid moves per state carefully (Flip Game II, Can I Win)

## interval_dp

**What it is** — Interval DP solves problems on contiguous subarrays or subsequences where the optimal answer for an interval `[l, r]` depends on answers for all smaller sub-intervals within it. Recognize it when you must consider all ways to split or combine a range — classic signals are "burst," "merge," "remove," "triangulate," or "partition a sequence optimally." The state is always `dp[l][r]` representing the best value for the subproblem on that range.

**Common steps**
1. Define `dp[l][r]` as the optimal value (max score, min cost, count of ways) for the subproblem on the interval `[l, r]`.
2. Base cases: single elements `dp[i][i]` or empty intervals `dp[i][i-1] = 0`.
3. Iterate by increasing interval **length** (not left index): for `length` from 2 to `n`, for each valid `l`, set `r = l + length - 1`.
4. For each `(l, r)`, try all split points `k` in `[l, r-1]` (or `[l+1, r]`): `dp[l][r] = min/max over k of (dp[l][k] + dp[k+1][r] + cost(l, k, r))`.
5. Be careful about the order: smaller intervals must be fully computed before larger ones.
6. The answer is `dp[0][n-1]`.

**Key variations**
- Splitting/merging with a cost (Burst Balloons, Minimum Cost to Merge Stones): the tricky part is what `cost(l, k, r)` is — for Burst Balloons it involves the "last burst" element
- Palindrome problems (Longest Palindromic Subsequence, Palindrome Partitioning III): base case `dp[i][i] = 1`; match or skip outer characters
- Optimal triangulation (Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon): split polygon by fixing one triangle at a time
- Counting over intervals (Count Different Palindromic Subsequences, Zuma Game): sum over valid splits
- Remove/group operations (Remove Boxes, Strange Printer): state may need extra dimensions beyond just `[l, r]`

## tree_dp

**What it is** — Tree DP computes optimal values on rooted trees by combining solutions from child subtrees. Recognize it when the problem involves a tree and the answer at each node depends on decisions made in its subtrees (e.g., include or exclude a node, choose a color, aggregate a metric). The natural computation order is a post-order DFS: children are fully resolved before the parent is computed.

**Common steps**
1. Root the tree at node 0 (or any convenient node) and run a DFS.
2. Define `dp[node][state]` where state captures the local decision at `node` (e.g., robbed/not robbed, color assigned).
3. In the DFS, first recurse on all children to get their dp values.
4. At each node, combine children results: for each valid state at `node`, pick the best compatible states from each child.
5. Return `dp[node]` up the call stack; the root's dp holds the global answer.
6. For re-rooting problems (answers needed for every root): do a second DFS top-down, propagating the parent's contribution back down.

**Key variations**
- Include/exclude at each node (House Robber III): `dp[node] = (rob_node, skip_node)`; if robbed, children must be skipped
- Subtree aggregation (Maximum Good Subtree Score, Subtree Inversion Sum): aggregate over all subtree nodes with a sum or bitmask
- Re-rooting technique: compute answers for all possible roots in O(n) using two DFS passes
- Tree knapsack (selecting k nodes across subtrees): combine child DPs like a multi-dimensional knapsack within the DFS

## bitmask_dp

**What it is** — Bitmask DP represents a subset of items as a binary integer (bitmask) and uses DP over all 2^n subsets to find an optimal assignment or traversal. Recognize it when `n` is small (typically n ≤ 20) and the problem involves assigning items to slots, visiting all nodes in a graph (TSP-style), or covering a set with subsets. The bit at position `i` being 1 means item `i` is in the current subset.

**Common steps**
1. Represent the subset of completed/assigned/visited items as an integer `mask` (0 to 2^n - 1).
2. Define `dp[mask][last]` (or just `dp[mask]`) as the best value when the items in `mask` have been handled, with `last` being the most recently added item if order matters.
3. Initialize `dp[0] = 0` (or `dp[0][start] = 0` for path problems).
4. Iterate over all masks in increasing order; for each mask, try adding any item `i` not yet in the mask: `new_mask = mask | (1 << i)`.
5. Transition: `dp[new_mask][i] = min/max(dp[new_mask][i], dp[mask][last] + cost(last, i))`.
6. Answer: `dp[(1<<n)-1]` (all items included) or aggregate over all final states.

**Key variations**
- Assignment problems (Maximum Compatibility Score, Campus Bikes II): match n workers to n jobs; state = subset of jobs assigned
- Hamiltonian path / TSP (Shortest Superstring, Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs): state = visited set + current position
- Coloring / painting with constraints (Painting a Grid, Student Exam Seating): encode row/column state as a bitmask
- Subset-sum over subsets (Number of Good Subsets, Stickers to Spell Word): iterate over all submasks of each mask
- Profile DP on grids (Painting a Grid With Three Different Colors): bitmask encodes the coloring of one row/column

## digit_dp

**What it is** — Digit DP counts integers in a range `[0, N]` (or `[L, R]`) satisfying a digit-level constraint (no repeating digits, sum of digits divisible by k, specific digit patterns). Recognize it when the problem asks "how many numbers from 1 to N have property X" and the property depends on individual digits. The key insight is to build the number digit by digit from most significant to least significant, tracking a "tight" flag that indicates whether the current prefix equals N's prefix.

**Common steps**
1. Convert N to its digit array.
2. Define `dp[pos][state][tight][started]` where `pos` = current digit position, `state` = the digit-constraint state (e.g., remainder, set of digits used), `tight` = are we still bounded by N's digits, `started` = have we placed a non-zero digit yet (handles leading zeros).
3. At each position, try placing digits 0 through `(tight ? N[pos] : 9)`.
4. If `tight` and we place `N[pos]`, the next state remains tight; otherwise it becomes free.
5. Memoize on `(pos, state, tight, started)` — the tight and started flags allow caching across calls.
6. For a range `[L, R]`, compute `f(R) - f(L-1)` using the standard digit DP on upper bound.

**Key variations**
- No repeated digits (Count Special Integers): state = bitmask of digits used so far
- Digit sum constraints (Count of Integers, Beautiful Integers): state = running sum or sum modulo k
- Consecutive digit constraints (Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones, Stepping Numbers): state = last digit placed
- Combined with string pattern matching (Find All Good Strings): state includes KMP automaton position
- Leading zero handling: use a `started` flag; before `started`, placing 0 doesn't change the digit state

## matrix_exponentiation_dp

**What it is** — Matrix exponentiation DP accelerates linear recurrences from O(n) to O(log n) by expressing the recurrence as a matrix multiplication and using fast matrix exponentiation. Recognize it when a DP recurrence involves a fixed-size state vector and the transition is the same at every step — meaning you need the value after a very large number of steps (n up to 10^18). The idea is that applying the transition matrix `n` times equals the matrix raised to the power `n`.

**Common steps**
1. Express the recurrence as a vector-matrix product: `state[i+1] = T * state[i]` where `T` is the constant transition matrix.
2. Identify the state vector (e.g., `[dp[i], dp[i-1], dp[i-2]]`) and build the transition matrix `T` that maps it to the next step.
3. Use fast matrix exponentiation (repeated squaring) to compute `T^n` in O(k^3 log n) where `k` is the matrix size.
4. Multiply `T^n` by the initial state vector to get the final state.
5. Apply modular arithmetic throughout all matrix multiplications.
6. Verify by checking small cases manually against the naive recurrence.

**Key variations**
- Simple linear recurrences (Fibonacci in O(log n)): 2x2 matrix
- Counting paths in a graph after exactly k steps: adjacency matrix raised to power k
- String transformation problems: encode character transitions as a matrix; exponentiate to count k-step transformations
- Ball-passing games (Maximize Value of Function): binary lifting — precompute jump[node][k] = node reached after 2^k passes
