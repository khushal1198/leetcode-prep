# Greedy

331 problems across 14 patterns.

## stock_trading

**What it is** — Stock trading problems ask you to maximize profit (or minimize loss) over a sequence of prices, where you decide when to buy and sell. The greedy insight is that in single-transaction problems you track the running minimum price, and in multi-transaction problems every upward price move is independently profitable so you collect each positive difference.

**Common steps**
1. Determine the constraint: one transaction, unlimited, or k transactions.
2. For one transaction: track `min_price` seen so far; at each step compute `price - min_price` and update `max_profit`.
3. For unlimited transactions: scan consecutive pairs; accumulate `price[i+1] - price[i]` whenever it is positive.
4. Return the accumulated profit (0 if never profitable).

**Key variations**
- Single buy/sell (LC 121): one pass tracking running minimum.
- Unlimited transactions (LC 122): sum all positive daily deltas; no state needed beyond the previous price.
- Cooldown / transaction fee variants: these shift from pure greedy to DP.

## greedy_sorting

**What it is** — These problems become tractable once you sort the input (or sort by a derived key), after which the optimal greedy choice at each position is obvious and locally verifiable. Recognise this pattern when the relative order of elements is the only thing standing between you and a simple linear scan.

**Common steps**
1. Identify the sorting key (raw values, differences, negatives first, custom comparator, etc.).
2. Sort the array (or use a frequency-sorted structure) in the required order.
3. Iterate linearly and apply the greedy rule (take, skip, pair, assign) at each position.
4. Accumulate the answer (count, sum, boolean flag).
5. Handle edge cases: ties in the sort key, even/odd parity, or leftover elements.

**Key variations**
- Pair adjacent elements after sorting (array partition, minimise difference).
- Sort descending then apply buy-every-third or similar discount rules.
- Sort by a composite key (value + label, or value + degree) for constrained selection.
- Custom comparator sort to form the lexicographically largest/smallest concatenation.
- Sort plus a second pass to greedily fix constraint violations (increment to unique, etc.).

## digit_construction

**What it is** — Digit construction problems ask you to build, modify, or remap the digits of a number to achieve an extremal (largest, smallest, most palindromic, etc.) result. The greedy insight is to process digits from the most significant position first and make the locally best swap or replacement at the first opportunity, then stop — changing an earlier digit dominates changing any later one.

**Common steps**
1. Convert the number to a list or string of its digits for easy manipulation.
2. Decide the direction: scan left-to-right for maximization (replace the first digit that can be improved), right-to-left for minimization.
3. At each position, check whether applying the allowed operation (remap, swap, delete, insert) strictly improves the current digit.
4. Apply the operation at the first beneficial position and stop (one-shot greedy) — or continue if the operation has unlimited uses.
5. Reconstruct the number from the modified digit list and return it.

**Key variations**
- Single remap of all occurrences of one digit (max/min difference).
- Remove exactly one digit to maximise the remaining number.
- Insert a digit at the optimal position.
- Replace a contiguous substring greedily from the left.
- Repeatedly apply an operation (monotone increasing digits requires a backward pass).

## greedy_counting

**What it is** — Greedy counting problems require you to count frequencies or track running tallies to make optimal decisions without looking ahead. The key observation is that the structure of the problem (character frequencies, parenthesis balance, group sizes) directly determines the minimum operations or maximum items, and a simple frequency-based rule gives the global optimum.

**Common steps**
1. Count element frequencies using a hash map or counter.
2. Sort or process the frequencies in a specific order (ascending for removal, descending for selection).
3. Apply a greedy rule at each step (remove the least frequent element first, fill groups greedily, pair complementary characters).
4. Track any running balance or remainder that carries over between steps.
5. Return the accumulated count of operations or the size of the result.

**Key variations**
- Frequency-based removal (remove least frequent to reduce distinct count by half).
- Group filling: divide elements into fixed-size groups greedily (hand of straights, consecutive subsequences).
- Parenthesis balancing: count unmatched opens and closes in one pass.
- Binary string alternation: count mismatches with both possible patterns and take the minimum.
- Pair-matching with a hash map (palindrome construction from two-letter words).

## task_assignment

**What it is** — Task assignment problems ask you to pair workers/machines/slots with tasks to optimise a global objective (minimise time, maximise value, or satisfy capacity constraints). The greedy insight is to sort both workers and tasks and match them in a specific order — biggest task to biggest worker, or smallest task to smallest worker — depending on whether you are maximising or minimising.

**Common steps**
1. Sort tasks by the relevant attribute (difficulty, duration, value).
2. Sort workers/resources by capacity (or derive their capacity).
3. Match tasks to workers using the appropriate greedy pairing strategy (largest-to-largest for maximisation, smallest-to-smallest for minimisation, or fill slots round-robin for keyboard-mapping style problems).
4. Track the running total (time used, profit earned, pushes needed) as you assign.
5. Return the accumulated result; check for impossible cases (task exceeds all worker capacities).

**Key variations**
- One-to-one matching (assign each task to exactly one worker).
- Many-to-one matching (fill workers up to capacity, e.g., keyboard key slots of size 8).
- Cooldown-constrained scheduling (Task Scheduler): use frequency of most common task to determine idle slots.
- Energy/threshold ordering: sort by `(actual - minimum)` difference to ensure sufficient starting energy.
- Parallel workers with identical machines (minimum completion time requires pairing max job with max worker).

## greedy_simulation

**What it is** — Greedy simulation problems require you to step through a process sequentially, making the locally optimal decision at each step rather than planning ahead. You recognise this pattern when each action permanently modifies a state (array values, a balance counter, a pointer position) and the best action at each position is self-evident given the current state — no backtracking is needed.

**Common steps**
1. Initialize any necessary state variables (running balance, pointer, current max, cost accumulator).
2. Iterate through the sequence one element at a time.
3. At each position, apply the greedy rule: perform the minimum forced operation, take the best available action, or skip if the constraint is already satisfied.
4. Update state variables to reflect the action taken.
5. After the full iteration, return the accumulated cost, count, or the modified structure.

**Key variations**
- Minimum increments to make a sequence strictly increasing (process left to right, bump each element above the previous).
- Flip-based problems: flip a window starting at each 0, track flips with a running XOR or difference array.
- Wiggle/zigzag arrangement: swap adjacent pairs whenever the pattern is violated.
- Simulating game rules (Dota Senate, Lemonade Change): use queues or counters to model each turn.
- Grid/matrix simulation: apply row or column operations in a fixed greedy order (highest bit first for Score After Flipping Matrix).

## gas_station

**What it is** — The gas station pattern solves circular-tour problems where you must find a starting position that allows you to complete a full loop given local surplus/deficit at each stop. The key insight is that if the total gas is at least total cost then a valid starting point always exists, and you can identify it in a single pass by resetting your candidate start whenever your running tank goes negative.

**Common steps**
1. Compute the net gain at each station: `net[i] = gas[i] - cost[i]`.
2. Check feasibility: if `sum(net) < 0`, return -1 (no valid start exists).
3. Scan left to right, accumulating a running `tank` total and tracking `candidate_start`.
4. Whenever `tank < 0`, reset `tank = 0` and set `candidate_start = i + 1`.
5. Return `candidate_start` (the reset point is provably the only viable start).

**Key variations**
- Standard single-start circular tour (LC 134).
- Extensions requiring minimum cost or multiple vehicles follow the same feasibility check but add a secondary objective.

## two_pointer_greedy

**What it is** — Two-pointer greedy problems place one pointer at each end (or at two strategic positions) of a sorted or structured sequence and decide at each step which pointer to move inward based on a greedy comparison. This avoids the O(n²) brute force and works because moving the suboptimal pointer can only hurt the objective, so the optimal pointer should stay fixed until the other catches up.

**Common steps**
1. Sort the input (if not already sorted) so the two extremes are well-defined.
2. Initialize `left = 0` and `right = n - 1`.
3. At each iteration, evaluate the current pair and record the contribution to the answer (max distance, minimum operations, boat count, etc.).
4. Apply the greedy rule to advance one pointer: move the pointer whose value is less promising (e.g., move `left` if `arr[left] + arr[right] <= limit`).
5. Repeat until the pointers meet; return the accumulated answer.

**Key variations**
- Pairing lightest with heaviest (Boats to Save People): fill each boat greedily.
- Matching two independent arrays (Advantage Shuffle in exchange_argument): sort both, use pointer on the opponent's sorted array.
- Shortest way to form a string: advance a pointer over the source for each character of the target.
- Bag of Tokens: spend the cheapest token for power, sell the most expensive for score.
- Finding the two extreme indices (min, max) and choosing the cheaper removal direction.

## greedy_math

**What it is** — Greedy math problems have an answer that follows directly from a mathematical or number-theoretic observation, so the optimal strategy can be expressed as a formula or a short computation rather than a full search. Recognise this pattern when the problem involves divisibility, bit manipulation, sums, or GCDs and a closed-form rule provably yields the best outcome.

**Common steps**
1. Identify the mathematical structure (modular arithmetic, bit properties, Fibonacci representation, greedy coin-change style argument).
2. Derive or recall the greedy rule that follows from that structure (e.g., always subtract the largest valid value, or always flip bits greedily from the highest position).
3. Apply the rule in a loop or a single formula, updating the running state (remaining target, current number, remaining budget).
4. Handle edge cases: parity constraints, impossibility conditions, or the difference between floor and ceiling divisions.
5. Return the computed count, sum, or constructed value.

**Key variations**
- Greedy coin/denomination change (Fibonacci numbers, deci-binary decomposition): always take the largest valid piece.
- Bit manipulation greedy (max XOR, minimize OR): process bits from most significant to least significant.
- Array equalization with a single operation type (minimum operations to make array equal II): derive the formula from the sum difference.
- Integer replacement / broken calculator: work backwards from the target, applying inverse operations greedily.
- Patching array: maintain the furthest reachable number and greedily add the smallest missing value.

## jump_game

**What it is** — Jump game problems ask whether you can reach a target (or how few jumps it takes) when each position tells you how far you can jump from there. The greedy insight is to track the furthest position reachable so far: if you are still within that reach, you can always extend it; if the current position exceeds the reach, the target is unreachable. For minimum jumps, greedily use the jump that extends your reach the most before you are forced to jump.

**Common steps**
1. Initialize `max_reach = 0` (furthest position reachable), `jumps = 0`, `current_end = 0` (end of current jump level).
2. Iterate through positions `0` to `n-2`.
3. Update `max_reach = max(max_reach, i + nums[i])` at each position.
4. When `i == current_end`, you must jump: increment `jumps`, set `current_end = max_reach`.
5. If at any point `max_reach < i`, the target is unreachable; otherwise return `jumps` (or `True` for reachability).

**Key variations**
- Reachability only (LC 55): return `max_reach >= n - 1` after a single pass.
- Minimum jumps (LC 45): count jumps whenever the current level boundary is crossed.
- Interval covering (Video Stitching, Minimum Taps): sort intervals by start, then greedily extend coverage with the interval that reaches furthest.
- Refueling stops (LC 871): use a max-heap to retroactively pick the largest refuel seen so far whenever you run out of fuel.

## activity_selection

**What it is** — Activity selection (also called interval scheduling) is the classic greedy problem of choosing the maximum number of non-overlapping activities (or the minimum number of "arrows" to cover all of them). The fundamental insight is to always select the activity that ends earliest, because it leaves the most room for future activities — this is a provably optimal exchange argument.

**Common steps**
1. Sort intervals by their end time (ascending).
2. Initialize `last_end = -infinity` and `count = 0`.
3. Iterate through the sorted intervals: if `interval.start >= last_end`, select this interval, update `last_end = interval.end`, and increment `count`.
4. Skip any interval that overlaps with the last selected one.
5. Return `count` (for maximum selections) or `n - count` (for minimum removals to make non-overlapping).

**Key variations**
- Maximum non-overlapping intervals (LC 435, 646): sort by end, count greedily selected intervals.
- Minimum arrows to burst balloons (LC 452): every new arrow is needed only when the current balloon starts after the last arrow position.
- Attend maximum events (LC 1353): use a min-heap of end times to always attend the earliest-ending available event each day.
- Earliest full bloom (LC 2136): sort by bloom time descending; greedily plant longest-blooming flowers first to minimise total wait.
- Course Schedule III (LC 630): use a max-heap to greedily swap out the longest course taken when the deadline is exceeded.

## greedy_string

**What it is** — Greedy string problems ask you to construct, modify, or partition a string to achieve a lexicographic or structural objective with the fewest operations. The greedy insight is to process characters left to right and make the locally best character-level decision at each position, exploiting the fact that earlier positions dominate lexicographic order or structural validity.

**Common steps**
1. Determine the objective: minimise lexicographic order, maximise it, or satisfy a structural constraint (no three consecutive same characters, valid parentheses, etc.).
2. Iterate over the string from left to right (or right to left for suffix-based problems).
3. At each position, apply the greedy rule: choose the smallest (or largest) valid character, skip/merge if a constraint would be violated, or count the operation forced by the current character.
4. Track any necessary state (remaining budget, last character used, frequency counts, open parenthesis balance).
5. Build the result character by character or return the accumulated operation count.

**Key variations**
- Lexicographically smallest/largest construction with a constraint (no palindrome substrings, no triple repeats).
- Minimum deletions or operations to satisfy a pattern (alternating, anti-palindrome, sorted columns).
- Partition into minimum substrings satisfying a value or uniqueness constraint.
- Break/modify exactly one substring or character to achieve a lexicographic goal.
- Two-string merge choosing the lexicographically larger character at each step (LC 1754).

## interval_scheduling

**What it is** — Interval scheduling problems deal with a set of intervals and ask you to merge them, count overlaps, partition them into groups, or cover points optimally. The unifying greedy strategy is to sort by one endpoint (start or end) and then sweep through, maintaining just enough state (current merged interval, active count, last covered point) to make each decision in O(1).

**Common steps**
1. Sort intervals by start time (or end time, depending on the sub-problem).
2. Initialize result structure (merged list, group count, point counter).
3. Sweep through sorted intervals one by one.
4. At each interval, decide: merge with the previous (if overlapping), open a new group (if no available group), or record a new covered segment.
5. Update state (extend the current interval's end, increment/decrement active count) and add to the result when a segment closes.

**Key variations**
- Merge overlapping intervals (LC 56): sort by start, extend end greedily.
- Count simultaneous meetings / minimum rooms (LC 253, 2406): use a min-heap of end times or a sweep-line event counter.
- Insert a new interval into a sorted list (LC 57): binary search for position, then merge.
- Maximum non-overlapping subarrays with a given property (LC 1546): combine prefix-sum with a greedy "take as early as possible" scan.
- Non-overlapping substrings or intervals with complex containment rules (LC 1520, 3557): sort by end, greedily extend coverage without backtracking.

## exchange_argument

**What it is** — Exchange argument problems require you to find the optimal ordering or assignment of elements by proving that swapping any two adjacent out-of-order elements improves (or does not worsen) the objective. Once you identify the pairwise comparison that defines "better order," sorting by that comparator gives the global optimum. This is the rigorous justification behind many greedy sorting strategies.

**Common steps**
1. Hypothesize a comparator: define when element A should come before element B.
2. Prove the exchange argument: show that swapping A and B when B precedes A improves the objective (e.g., reduces cost, increases profit).
3. Sort the elements using that comparator.
4. Apply any secondary greedy step needed after sorting (e.g., binary search for matching, take top-k, or accumulate a running value).
5. Return the optimised total.

**Key variations**
- Minimise product sum: sort one array ascending, the other descending, then pair them.
- Two-city scheduling: sort by `cost_A - cost_B` and send the first half to city A.
- Advantage shuffle: sort both arrays; for each opponent value, assign the smallest value that can beat it (binary search on your sorted array).
- Weighted scheduling with deadlines: sort by deadline or by a ratio like `damage / time` to minimise total damage taken.
- Multi-item knapsack with exchange: greedily swap out included items to improve a secondary metric (Maximum Elegance LC 2813).
