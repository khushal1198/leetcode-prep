227 problems across 12 patterns.

## bfs_level_order

**What it is** — BFS level-order traversal processes a tree one level at a time using a queue. You push all nodes of the current level into the queue, then drain it completely before moving to the next level. Recognize this pattern when a problem asks about levels, depths, rows, or anything that requires comparing or aggregating nodes at the same depth.

**Common steps**
1. Initialize a queue with the root node (guard against null root).
2. While the queue is non-empty, record `level_size = len(queue)`.
3. Loop exactly `level_size` times: pop a node, process it, and enqueue its non-null children.
4. After the inner loop, one full level has been processed — store or update your result for that level.
5. Repeat until the queue is empty; return the accumulated result.

**Key variations**
- Collect all node values per level (standard level-order) vs. a single aggregate per level (sum, max, average).
- Zigzag / alternating direction: toggle a flag and reverse every other level's list.
- Right side view / left side view: only record the first or last node of each level.
- Next-right pointers: instead of a separate list, link siblings directly during traversal.
- BFS from a target node outward (treat tree as undirected graph) for distance problems.
- Track column indices (vertical order) by pairing each node with its column offset in the queue.

## dfs_traversal

**What it is** — DFS traversal visits every node in a tree by recursively (or iteratively with a stack) going as deep as possible before backtracking. The three orderings — preorder (root first), inorder (left, root, right), postorder (children first) — determine when you process a node relative to its subtrees. Recognize this pattern when you need to visit every node or propagate information up or down the tree.

**Common steps**
1. Define a recursive helper that takes the current node (and any state being carried, e.g., running sum, max so far).
2. Write the base case: if node is null, return a neutral value (0, True, infinity, etc.).
3. Recurse into left child, then right child (swap order for right-first variants).
4. Combine the results from left and right subtrees with the current node's value.
5. Return the combined result upward (postorder) or use the current node before recursing (preorder).
6. For iterative DFS, use an explicit stack; push right child before left so left is processed first.

**Key variations**
- Preorder for path-building and cloning (process node before children).
- Inorder for BST problems (yields sorted order).
- Postorder for bottom-up aggregation (height, diameter, subtree sums).
- Carry state downward (max from root, restricted nodes) vs. aggregate state upward.
- N-ary trees: loop over all children instead of just left/right.
- Iterative with an explicit stack to avoid recursion depth limits on large inputs.

## bst_operations

**What it is** — BST operations exploit the binary search tree invariant: every node in the left subtree is strictly less than the current node, and every node in the right subtree is strictly greater. This ordering lets you search, insert, delete, and validate in O(h) time by eliminating half the remaining tree at each step. Recognize this pattern when the problem involves a BST and you can use value comparisons to direct traversal instead of visiting every node.

**Common steps**
1. At each node, compare the target value (or range bounds) against `node.val`.
2. If the target equals `node.val`, you have found what you need — process it.
3. If the target is less than `node.val`, recurse or move to the left child.
4. If the target is greater than `node.val`, recurse or move to the right child.
5. For range queries (e.g., range sum), recurse into both subtrees only when the range overlaps that side; prune the other side.
6. For in-order traversal problems, use a running variable (previous node or accumulator) since inorder yields sorted order.

**Key variations**
- Search and closest-value: standard compare-and-move, track closest seen so far.
- Insert: recurse down until you hit null, create the new node there.
- Delete: three cases — leaf, one child, two children (replace with inorder successor/predecessor).
- Validate: pass allowed `[min, max]` bounds down recursively; a node is invalid if it violates its bounds.
- Convert to/from sorted order: inorder traversal + rebuild or running-sum accumulation (reverse inorder for greater sum tree).
- Two BSTs: merge by extracting inorder lists from both and merging like merge-sort.

## balanced_tree

**What it is** — A balanced binary tree has the property that for every node, the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most one (AVL-style balance). Problems in this pattern ask you to either check whether a tree satisfies this condition or to restructure an unbalanced tree into a balanced one. Recognize this pattern when the problem explicitly mentions balance, or when a BST is built from a sorted sequence and needs to be height-minimal.

**Common steps**
1. Write a postorder DFS helper that returns the height of each subtree.
2. At each node, compute `left_height` and `right_height` by recursing into both children.
3. Check if `abs(left_height - right_height) <= 1`; if not, mark the tree (or subtree) as unbalanced.
4. Return `1 + max(left_height, right_height)` upward, or -1 as a sentinel to signal imbalance.
5. To construct a balanced BST from a sorted list: pick the middle element as root, then recursively build left and right subtrees from the left and right halves.

**Key variations**
- Checking balance: return early (-1 sentinel) the moment any subtree is unbalanced to avoid unnecessary work.
- Constructing balance: extract BST inorder traversal into a sorted array, then recursively build from the sorted array using mid-point selection.

## subtree_properties

**What it is** — Subtree property problems ask you to compute or verify a value that is defined over an entire subtree (e.g., sum, size, color, structure) and then use that result to answer a question about the whole tree. The key insight is that a subtree's property depends only on the properties of its children's subtrees, making postorder DFS the natural fit. Recognize this when a problem asks you to count, find, or compare subtrees based on some aggregate.

**Common steps**
1. Define what information each subtree needs to return (e.g., sum, size, min, max, is_valid flag).
2. Write a postorder DFS: recurse left, recurse right, then compute the current node's property from the returned values.
3. At each node, update a global result variable if the current subtree satisfies the target condition.
4. Return the subtree's property upward so the parent can use it.
5. For duplicate or equivalence checks, serialize the subtree into a hashable form (string or tuple) and use a hash map.

**Key variations**
- Aggregate sums/sizes: straightforward postorder accumulation.
- Structural checks (univalue, perfect, complete): return a flag alongside size/height.
- Subtree matching: serialize subtrees to strings and compare with a hash set.
- Diameter / longest path through a node: compute left and right depths, update global max with their sum, return the longer depth + 1.
- Equal partition: compute total sum first, then check if any subtree sum equals half the total.
- Label/color counting: carry a frequency map upward and merge children's maps.

## tree_modification

**What it is** — Tree modification problems require you to structurally change a tree in-place or return a new tree with altered connections, node values, or shape. Unlike pure traversal, you must rewire child pointers or delete/insert nodes. Recognize this pattern when the problem asks you to prune, flatten, invert, merge, or otherwise reshape the tree rather than just read from it.

**Common steps**
1. Recurse postorder so children are already modified before you process the current node.
2. At each node, decide what to do based on the modified left and right subtrees (e.g., whether to keep or prune).
3. Rewire `node.left` and `node.right` to point to the new (possibly null) subtree roots.
4. Return the node that should take this position in the parent's tree — sometimes the node itself, sometimes a child, sometimes null.
5. For flattening or relinking (e.g., flatten to linked list), use a running "previous" pointer and reorder connections in postorder or reverse-preorder.

**Key variations**
- Prune based on a condition (leaf value, path sum): return null from base to remove a node; bubble up from postorder.
- Invert / mirror: swap left and right children at every node (preorder or postorder, both work).
- Merge two trees: simultaneously recurse both trees; sum values, recurse into paired children.
- Flatten to linked list: use reverse-preorder (right, left, root) with a `prev` pointer to build the list in-place.
- Add/delete a row at a specific depth: use BFS or DFS with a depth counter to reach the target level.
- Delete a set of nodes: postorder to handle children first, then decide whether the current node stays or becomes new roots.

## tree_design

**What it is** — Tree design problems ask you to implement a data structure or class that wraps a tree and supports efficient repeated queries or updates through a well-defined API. Rather than solving a single static problem, you design the internal state and methods so that each operation runs within a target time complexity. Recognize this pattern when the problem presents a class with multiple method signatures (e.g., `insert`, `find`, `next`, `getOrder`) that must be implemented together.

**Common steps**
1. Identify what data the class needs to store as instance variables (the tree itself, auxiliary structures like a deque or hash set, iterators).
2. In the constructor, build any precomputed structures (e.g., reconstruct a contaminated tree, lay out a complete binary tree as an array).
3. For each method, decide whether to traverse lazily on each call or maintain incremental state.
4. Use helper data structures alongside the tree — a queue for complete-tree insertion order, a stack for iterative inorder, a list for preorder traversal tracking.
5. Test edge cases: empty tree, single node, operations interleaved in unusual order.

**Key variations**
- Iterator pattern (BST Iterator): use a stack to simulate inorder traversal one step at a time; `next()` pops and pushes right subtree.
- Complete tree inserter: maintain a deque of nodes that still have room for children; pop when both children are filled.
- Contaminated tree recovery: DFS to assign correct values (root=0, left child=2*parent+1, right child=2*parent+2), store in a hash set for O(1) `find`.
- Hierarchy / inheritance modeling (Throne Inheritance): use an adjacency list and a dead set; DFS preorder for the order, skipping dead nodes.
- Tree encoding: map an N-ary tree onto a binary tree using left-child/right-sibling representation.

## path_sum

**What it is** — Path sum problems ask you to find, count, or optimize over paths in a tree where each path's value is the sum (or some function) of the node values along it. A path can run root-to-leaf, root-to-any-node, or any-node-to-any-node (going up and over). Recognize this pattern when the problem involves accumulating values along a path and checking or optimizing that accumulated value.

**Common steps**
1. For root-to-leaf paths: carry a running sum downward through DFS; at each leaf check if it equals the target.
2. For root-to-any-node paths: track the current prefix sum; at each node check `current_sum == target`.
3. For any-node-to-any-node paths (path through a node): compute `left_gain` and `right_gain` from children (clamped to 0 if negative), update a global result with `node.val + left_gain + right_gain`, and return `node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)` upward.
4. For counting paths with a given sum: use a prefix-sum hash map (similar to subarray sum equals k); store `{prefix_sum: count}` and look up `prefix_sum - target` at each node.
5. Backtrack the prefix-sum map when returning from a subtree (undo the current node's contribution).

**Key variations**
- Root-to-leaf only: must reach a leaf node, not just any node; add an explicit leaf check.
- Return all paths vs. just count: for all paths, carry a path list and append/pop (backtrack).
- Path as a number (binary number, digit string): multiply or concatenate instead of adding.
- Longest consecutive path: track direction (ascending/descending) and reset count when broken.
- Any-direction path with constraints (pseudo-palindrome, distinct values): carry a bitmask or set alongside the running value.
- Paths across two nodes using LCA: find the two paths from root to each node and combine at their meeting point.

## tree_construction

**What it is** — Tree construction problems ask you to build a tree from a non-tree representation such as a traversal sequence, a sorted array, a parent-child description list, or a string encoding. The core challenge is determining which element becomes the root and how to partition the remaining data into left and right subtrees. Recognize this pattern when you are given raw data (not an existing tree) and must reconstruct or generate a valid tree structure.

**Common steps**
1. Identify the root: in preorder sequences it is the first element; in sorted arrays it is the middle element; in inorder+postorder it is the last element of postorder.
2. Locate the root's position in any complementary traversal (e.g., find the root's index in the inorder array) to determine the split between left and right subtrees.
3. Recurse on the left portion of each sequence to build the left subtree.
4. Recurse on the right portion to build the right subtree.
5. Link root.left and root.right to the results and return root.
6. Use a hash map of value-to-index for the inorder array to make root-finding O(1) instead of O(n).

**Key variations**
- Preorder + inorder: root is preorder[0]; its inorder index splits left/right sizes.
- Inorder + postorder: root is postorder[-1]; same split logic.
- Sorted array to BST: always pick the mid index as root for minimum height.
- Sorted linked list to BST: use slow/fast pointer to find the mid node, or convert to array first.
- Single preorder sequence for BST: use a valid range [min, max] to greedily assign nodes without needing an inorder array.
- From parent-child description list: build a hash map of parent-to-children and a set of all children to identify the root (the node that appears as a parent but never as a child).

## lowest_common_ancestor

**What it is** — The Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes p and q is the deepest node in the tree that has both p and q as descendants (where a node is considered a descendant of itself). LCA is the foundation for computing distances between nodes, finding paths between nodes, and many tree query problems. Recognize this pattern when a problem involves two nodes and asks about their relationship, distance, or a shared structural point.

**Common steps**
1. Base case: if the current node is null, or equals p or q, return the current node.
2. Recurse into the left subtree and the right subtree.
3. If both recursive calls return non-null results, the current node is the LCA — return it.
4. If only one side returns non-null, bubble that result upward (both p and q are in the same subtree).
5. For BST-specific LCA: use the BST property — if both p and q are less than `node.val`, go left; if both are greater, go right; otherwise the current node is the LCA.
6. For node-distance problems: find LCA, compute depth of p and q from root, then `dist = depth(p) + depth(q) - 2 * depth(LCA)`.

**Key variations**
- Standard binary tree LCA: postorder DFS returning the found node or null.
- BST LCA: iterative comparison using BST ordering, no full traversal needed.
- LCA with parent pointers: walk both nodes up to root, collect ancestor sets, find the first common ancestor.
- LCA of deepest leaves: find the deepest level first, then find LCA of all nodes at that level.
- Multiple nodes LCA: treat the set of target nodes like p and q; return when a node is in the set.
- Path between two nodes: find LCA, extract path from each node to LCA and concatenate.
- Binary lifting for repeated LCA queries: precompute 2^k ancestors for each node; answer each query in O(log n).

## serialization

**What it is** — Serialization converts a tree into a flat string or byte stream that can be stored or transmitted, and deserialization reconstructs the original tree from that encoding. The challenge is choosing an encoding that unambiguously captures the tree's structure, including null children, so the tree can be uniquely reconstructed. Recognize this pattern when asked to encode/decode a tree, or when you need to create a canonical string representation of a tree structure.

**Common steps**
1. Choose a traversal order for serialization — preorder is most common because the root comes first, making deserialization straightforward.
2. At each node, write the node's value followed by a delimiter (e.g., comma); write a null marker (e.g., `#`) when a child is absent.
3. For deserialization, split the string on the delimiter and use a pointer or iterator over the token list.
4. Reconstruct preorder: consume the next token — if it is the null marker, return null; otherwise create a node, recurse for its left child, then recurse for its right child.
5. For BST serialization, you can omit null markers and use the BST property during deserialization (valid-range approach), producing a more compact encoding.

**Key variations**
- Binary tree: requires explicit null markers to distinguish shape; preorder or level-order both work.
- BST: can skip null markers since node values constrain valid positions; reconstruct using valid range during preorder deserialization.
- N-ary tree: encode the number of children after each node's value, then recurse for each child.
- Canonical subtree hashing: serialize subtrees to strings and store in a hash map to identify duplicates (used in subtree problems, not just I/O).

## binary_tree_dp

**What it is** — Binary tree DP combines the structural recursion of DFS with dynamic programming: each node computes an optimal value based on the optimal values of its subtrees, and the choices made at a node can affect what choices are valid or beneficial in its subtrees. This is postorder DFS where the return value from each child encodes the DP state (e.g., "best result if I take this node" vs. "best result if I skip this node"). Recognize this pattern when a tree problem has an optimization objective and decisions at one node constrain or interact with decisions at its ancestors or descendants.

**Common steps**
1. Define the DP state returned by each recursive call — typically a tuple like `(take, skip)` or a single optimal value with constraints encoded implicitly.
2. Recurse into both children and receive their DP states.
3. At the current node, compute each possible choice by combining the appropriate child states (e.g., if you take this node, you must skip its children).
4. Return the DP state for this node upward to the parent.
5. After the full recursion, read the answer from the root's returned state.
6. For global-path problems (max path sum, diameter): maintain a global variable updated at each node, while the return value only carries the best single-arm contribution upward.

**Key variations**
- Include/exclude DP (e.g., tree cameras, house robber on tree): return `(with_node, without_node)` from each call.
- Diameter / longest path: the answer passes through a node using both arms; return only the best single arm upward.
- Coin/value redistribution (distribute coins): count excess at each subtree; moves = sum of absolute excesses.
- Rerooting technique: compute an answer for one root via postorder, then propagate corrections to all other roots in a second DFS — enables O(n) solutions for "answer at every root" problems.
- Tree knapsack: group related values by subtree and optimize a weighted selection; often requires Euler-tour flattening.
- Binary lifting / sparse table for ancestor queries: precompute 2^k-th ancestors in O(n log n) to answer kth-ancestor or path queries in O(log n).
